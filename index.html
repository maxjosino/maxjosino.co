        I'm currently the Founding Product Designer at
        <a href="https://joinground.com/" target="_blank">Ground</a>
        (Techstars and Female Founders Fund). Previously, I was one of the
        first design hires at
        <a
          href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nubank"
          target="_blank"
          >Nubank</a
        >
        (NYSE: NU), and later joined
        <a href="https://fast.co" target="_blank">Fast</a>, backed by Stripe
        and Index Ventures.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Nubank, I helped shape the future of banking services in LATAM. I
        worked across Credit Card, Customer Support, and Payments, combining
        design and engineering to build experiences that now serve over 100
        million customers.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Fast, I focused on scaling our Design System across teams and
        driving adoption among engineers and designers. I also designed the
        1-Click Checkout experience and the Mobile SDK for merchants.
